HDR 1.0 middleware


WHAT IT DOES?
=============

A platform-independent HDR middleware that
interacts with Camera HAL and HDR HAL.


HOW IT WAS BUILT?
==================

It needs the following libs from AOSP:
1. libutils.so
2. libcutils.so
3. libmedia.so

and the following libs from MediaTek:
1. libcamalgo
2. libfeatureio
3. libcam_utils
4. libcam.iopipe
5. libcam.camshot
6. libcameracustom
7. libm4u
8. libcamdrv

All source/dependency modules of this module are already put in
'vendor/mediatek/libs' folder.


HOW TO USE IT?
==============

All modules (e.g. Camera HAL or an unit test) should use
IHDRProc as the public interface to talk with HDR HAL.

All the source code of this program were written by MediaTek co..
